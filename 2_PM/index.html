          Hi! My name is Jota Chamorro. I'm a freshman at Harvard University
          interested in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Psychology. Here at
          Harvard, I'm involved in Harvard Organization for Latin America,
          Datamatch Web Team, Product Lab, and Harvard Computer Society. I am
          interested in exploring the potential uses of technology for social
          good. I was born and raised in Spain, in Santander. My hobbies include
          playing the piano, tennis, cooking, traveling, and spending time with
          my friends. Before coming to Harvard, I went to a Spanish high school
          where I concurrently pursued both the Spanish Scientific Diploma and
          the American Diploma. After graduating, I took a gap year, during
          which I was a part-time Mathematics student at the University of
          Cantabria, worked as a math tutor for high school students, a
          marketing and sales intern, improved my french and travelled through
          Spain.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was applying to Harvard, I realized how little information
          there is for Spanish-speaking international students looking to apply
          to colleges in the US, which left me feeling alone and unsupported
          throughout the process. For that reason, I created a YouTube channel
          during my gap year in which I try to demystify the college admissions
          process and inspire students who might not normally consider applying
          to schools like Harvard by creating the content I would've found
          helpful back when I was applying. I’ve amassed over 45,000 subscribers
          and 2,500,000 views in six months, but more so than numbers, I’m most
          impacted by the comments I get from Hispanic students about how they
          feel inspired and how they were unaware Harvard could be accessible
          for them.
